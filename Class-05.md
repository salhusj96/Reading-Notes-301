# **What Is Patch Tuesday for Windows, and When Is It?**
## *Why is this topic important?*
- It's important that we as Cybersecurity professionals become familiar with one of the largest tech company's update schedule, especially considering that not only will we be using Windows for all of our forseeable futures, but so will most of the tech world.
### **What Is Microsoft’s Patch Tuesday?**
- Patch Tuesday is an unofficial term for the day when Microsoft releases update packages for the Windows operating system and other Microsoft software applications, including Microsoft Office.
- As Microsoft patches security vulnerabilities, it doesn’t release those patches immediately. Instead, the company gathers those fixes into a larger update, which is released on Patch Tuesday.
### **When Is Patch Tuesday?**
- Patch Tuesday occurs on the second Tuesday of each month. More precisely, it occurs on the second Tuesday of each month in North America.
- These updates generally arrive around 10 a.m. Pacific Standard Time, but they may be released later in the day.
### **Updates Aren’t Only Released on Tuesdays**
- Patch Tuesday isn’t the only date updates arrive. In some cases, Microsoft will issue “out-of-band” updates for particularly critical security flaws, especially ones that are being exploited in the wild.
### **Patch Tuesday Is For “B” Updates**
- In Microsoft’s update parlance, Patch Tuesday updates are called “B” updates because they’re released in the second week of each month.
- Microsoft also issues optional update packages in the third or fourth weeks of the month. They’re known as the “C” and “D” updates. These include bug fixes and improvements for problems that aren’t security holes. After these updates are tested, their fixes make it into next month’s B update on Patch Tuesday.
### **Patch Tuesday Isn’t Just For Microsoft**
- Other companies have chosen to join Patch Tuesday to make things easier for system administrators to update their systems with security patches.
### **Patch Tuesday Isn’t For Windows 10’s Big Updates**
- Microsoft now releases big updates to Windows 10 once every six months. For example, Windows 10’s last big update was the May 2019 Update, and it was preceded by the October 2018 Update.
- These updates aren’t released on Patch Tuesday. They’re released on whatever day Microsoft decides to release them.

## **Things I want to know more about**
- Does the concedpt/schedule of 'Patch Tuesday' apply to Linux and other OS's as well, or just microsoft?
- I wonder if, in the past, has anyone ever exploited this schedule in some way?
